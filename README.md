# Description

Helping Hands is our capstone project for LaunchCode's Liftoff program. It is a mutual aid app designed to connect people in need with their neighbors who can share.

Our design goal is to create an easy-to-use app to connect members of a community so that they can share their resources, labor and skills to help each other build better communities, whether that's by starting a community garden, donating school supplies, or starting a little free library.

# Info

The frontend was created using create-react-app. It also utilizes Material Design components and Bootstrap CSS.

The backend is written in Spring with a MySQL database.
